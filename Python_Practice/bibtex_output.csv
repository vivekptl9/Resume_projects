abstract,"First prototypes of the DIRICH module were obtained last year and were throughly tested  and are now ready for mass production. In November 2017 this DiRICH concept was tested  at COSY under real beam conditions along with H12700 MAPMTs in a small prototype setup.  In this talk we present first results from the analysis of beam test data, focussing in particular  on efficiency and ToT usage for crosstalk suppression. In addition we also discuss the effect  of a Wavelength Shifting coating (WLS) of the"
