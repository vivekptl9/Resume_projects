abstract,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is a dedicated heavy ion collision experiment at the FAIR facility. It will be one of the first HEP experiments which works in a triggerless mode: data received in the DAQ from the detectors will not be associated with events by a hardware trigger anymore. All raw data within a giventime period will be collected continuously in containers, so-called time-slices. The task of the reconstruction algorithms is to create events out of this raw data stream. In this contribution, the optimization"
